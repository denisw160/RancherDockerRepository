# Docker Registry

(Source from: https://docs.docker.com/registry/)

## What it is

The Registry is a stateless, highly scalable server side application that stores and lets you distribute Docker images. The Registry is open-source, under the permissive Apache license.

## Why use it

You should use the Registry if you want to:
 - tightly control where your images are being stored
 - fully own your images distribution pipeline
 - integrate image storage and distribution tightly into your in-house development workflow
