# Graylog

## Finally, all your log data available and accessible in one central location

Discover and resolve issues faster. Keep end users happy with less downtime and better performance by proactively monitoring key indicators and exceptions across the entire stack.

*Message Processing Pipeline*

It's easy to parse and enrich logs from any data source using Graylog's flexible processing engine. Reuse code and simplify rule management by composing stages in named pipelines. Add your own enrichment and parsing functions for additional flexibility.

*Search*

Search through terabytes of log data to discover and analyze important information. Use the powerful search syntax to find exactly what you are looking for. Save search queries to share.
Ideas: Find application errors across all servers with a single query. Investigate the activity of a suspicious user ID in the last hour. Discover the single misconfigured firewall in your network.

*Dashboards*

Create dashboards to visualize metrics and observe trends in one central location. The simple user interface enables team members to easily access the wealth of information and add new charts.
